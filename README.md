# Python for Data science
### DESCRIPTION:

#### we can divide python into 4 stages:

     -> Python Basics
     -> Python Intermediate
     -> Python Advanced
     -> Python Production Level
### what we will learn
 - Understand basics and more advanced concepts in python
   language.
 - Be introduced to data analysis using pandas,numpy
   and data analysis library.
 - walk through the process of interviewing
   and answering technical questions.
 - learn how to build projects on real-world applications
   with the python language.
## Python Basics
 - Data types
 
 - variables
 - Operators
 - Print conditions
## Data types
 ->In general, data types specifies what type of data will be in variables

 ->Python provides following standard data types:

    1.Numbers
    2.String
 #### 1.Numbers:
 ->Numbers store numeric values

 ->There are 3 numeric types in python
 
    1.int:It is a whole number,positive and negative
            without decimals.
      example: a=7,b=-11,c=-23
    2.float:It is a floating number,positive or negative
            with containing one or more decimals.
      example: p=2.12,q=16.0,r=-4.6
    3.complex:Complex numbers are written with a"j" as the
            imaginary part.
      example: a=3+5j,b=-4+9j,c=-27j
  #### 2.String:
  ->The string can be defined as a sequence of characters
    represented in quotation marks.

  example: s1='Hi', s2="Hello", s3="'world'"
  ## variables
 ->A variable is a named memory location in which we can store values for the particular program.

 ->In Python, We don't need to declare explicitly variable in Python. When we assign any value to the variable that variable is declared automatically.

 ->In Python, We don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a loosely typed language.
 
    -Rules for naming variable:

 ->Variable names can be a group of both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.

 ->It is recommended to use lowercase letters for variable name. 'SUM' and 'sum' both are two different variables.

example:

a=12 #interger

b=1.2 #float

c="Hello" #string

->Python allows us to assign a value to multiple variables and multiple values to multiple variables in a single statement which is also known as multiple assignment.

    Assign single value to multiple variables:

example:

a=b=c=10
