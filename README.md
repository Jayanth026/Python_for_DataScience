# Python for Data science
### DESCRIPTION:

#### we can divide python into 4 stages:

     -> Python Basics
     -> Python Intermediate
     -> Python Advanced
     -> Python Production Level
### what we will learn
 - Understand basics and more advanced concepts in python
   language.
 - Be introduced to data analysis using pandas,numpy
   and data analysis library.
 - walk through the process of interviewing
   and answering technical questions.
 - learn how to build projects on real-world applications
   with the python language.
## Python Basics
 - Data types
 
 - variables
 - Operators
 - Print conditions
## Data types
 ->In general, data types specifies what type of data will be in variables

 ->Python provides following standard data types:

    1.Numbers
    2.String
 #### 1.Numbers:
 ->Numbers store numeric values

 ->There are 3 numeric types in python
 
    1.int:It is a whole number,positive and negative
            without decimals.
      example: a=7,b=-11,c=-23
    2.float:It is a floating number,positive or negative
            with containing one or more decimals.
      example: p=2.12,q=16.0,r=-4.6
    3.complex:Complex numbers are written with a"j" as the
            imaginary part.
      example: a=3+5j,b=-4+9j,c=-27j
  #### 2.String:
  ->The string can be defined as a sequence of characters
    represented in quotation marks.

  example: s1='Hi', s2="Hello", s3="'world'"
  ## variables
 ->A variable is a named memory location in which we can store values for the particular program.

 ->In Python, We don't need to declare explicitly variable in Python. When we assign any value to the variable that variable is declared automatically.

 ->In Python, We don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a loosely typed language.
 
    -Rules for naming variable:

 ->Variable names can be a group of both letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.

 ->It is recommended to use lowercase letters for variable name. 'SUM' and 'sum' both are two different variables.

example:

a=12 #interger

b=1.2 #float

c="Hello" #string

->Python allows us to assign a value to multiple variables and multiple values to multiple variables in a single statement which is also known as multiple assignment.

    Assign single value to multiple variables:

example:

a=b=c=10
## Operators
->Operators in Python are special symbols that carry arithmetic or logical operations. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

->In python there are 7 different types of Operators:
### Arithmetic Operators:
    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    *(multiplication)
    /(divide)
    %(reminder)
    // (floor division)
    ** (exponent)
### Membership Operators:
    in (True, If the value is present in the data structure)   
    not in (True, If the value is not present in the data
    structure)
### Comparison operators:
    == (Equal to)
    != (Not equal to)
    <= (Less than or equal)
    >= (Greater than or equal)
    < (Less than)
    > (Greater than)
### Assignment operators:
    = (Assigns to)
    += (Assignment after Addition)
    -= (Assignment after Subtraction)
    *= (Assignment after Multiplication)
    /= (Assignment after Division)
    %= (Assignment after Modulus)
    **= (Assignment after Exponent)
    //= (Assignment after floor division)
### Bitwise operators:
    & (binary and)
    | (binary or)
    ^ (binary xor)
    ~ (negation)
    << (left shift)
    >> (right shift)
### Logical operators:
    and (logical and)
    or (logical or)
    not (logical not)
### Identity operators:
    is (Returns true if both variables are the same object)
    is not (Returns true if both variables are not the same object)
